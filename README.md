## Problem Statement
The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, is characterized by extreme volatility and rapid price changes. Accurately predicting short-term price movements of Bitcoin can provide substantial advantages for traders and investors, enabling more informed decision-making and potential profit maximization. However, the inherent volatility and the influence of various external factors make this prediction task highly challenging. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict short-term price movements of Bitcoin using historical price data obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage LSTM networks to predict short-term price movements of Bitcoin based on historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the historical Bitcoin price data.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **models**: Saved models and weights.
- **images**: Contains images used in the README and notebooks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
